# Rescue

Rescue is a mod for the game Factorio.

## Story

You came to this planet in response to a rescue signal. Unfortunately you were shot down as you approached.
Luckily you survived the crash and now it's up to you to save those poor souls that are still hiding out there.

## Gameplay

In this mod you don't have access to anything more advanced than burner mining drills and stone furnaces. 
There are no ore patches outside your starting area. You have to venture out to rescue colonist outposts. 
Once rescued these colonists will supply you with a steady stream of resources.
As you rescue an outpost, another one will be randomly generated a little further away than the previous one. 
The more outposts you rescue, the more advanced materials they will provide. But beware, they will also be more heavily besieged!

The idea is that you are encouraged to focus on building a good military and train network early on. 
During the midgame you will mostly be busy connecting the remote outposts.

#### Changes

Rescue is designed to be playable as a vanilla experience with a big twist. The only recipe that had to be 
changed is purple science. It now requires a substation instead of electric furnace to build.


## Credits

Huge credits go to Klonan, the developer of the [Mining Drones](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Mining_Drones) mod, which
lies at the foundation for the Rescue idea.

## Wishes

- Balance the game so that players still need to build starter base small quantities of everything,
  but they don't have to upscale after that.
